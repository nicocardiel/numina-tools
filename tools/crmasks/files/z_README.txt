Edit run_extract*.sh and insert the correct line numbers.

The relevant line numbers are displayed using (enlarging the terminal width):
$ cat -n terminal_output_example1.txt  
(press command+k to clean the window before pressing ENTER)

Note that the scripts run_extract*.sh are not intended to be executed here.
They are executed every time "make html" is invoked (see the corresponding
Makefile).
