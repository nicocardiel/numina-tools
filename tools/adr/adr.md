# Atmospheric differential refraction

## compare_adr_extensions_in_3d_cube

This script computes the correction for differential atmospheric refraction
present in a 3D data cube, by reading the information from two specific
extensions (e.g., `ADRCROSS`, `ADRTHEOR`).

## compute_adr_wavelength

This script calculates the effect of atmospheric refraction, using a predefined
wavelength as reference.
